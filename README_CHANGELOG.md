Sphinx Secrets — demo

This is a small Next.js demo site showcasing a travel-themed UI called "Sphinx Secrets".

What I changed to make it more unique and wonderful:

- Added a refined Hero with Playfair Display headings and subtle SVG backdrop.
- Improved Tour carousel with autoplay and accessible controls.
- Polished city cards with badges, CTA, and hover elevation.
- Added Google Fonts and Tailwind theme tweaks (gold accents and serif heading font).

Quick start

```
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Notes

- This repo uses Tailwind CSS. If you see missing styles, ensure your PostCSS/Tailwind setup is active and you've installed dependencies.
- I kept changes small and low-risk to preserve the original project structure. If you'd like, I can add image assets, tweak colors, or add unit tests next.
